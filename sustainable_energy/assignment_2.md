# What are the EU targets?
The European Union has ambitious greenhouse gas targets. These targets are split into three phases, long term, medium term and short term targets.[1]

## Long Term Targets

The 2050 low-carbon enconomy roadmap[2] suggests the EU should cut emmissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.

## Medium Term Targets
The 2030 climate and energy framework[3]

  * At least 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels)
  * At least 27% share for renewable energy
  * At least 27% improvement in energy efficiency

## Short Term Targets
The 20-20-20 targets[4] are a set of binding targets for the year 2020.

  * 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels)
  * 20% of EU energy from renewables
  * 20% improvement in energy efficiency

These are the main targets that will be discussed here.

# Overall progress

According to Eurostat[Source: Eurostat (online data code: env_air_gge), European Energy Agency, European Topic Centre on Air and Climate
], in 1990 the EU produced 5,632,126.62 thousand tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions.
The figure in 2012 was 4,548,355.03 thousand tonnes. This is a reduction of nearly 19%. At first glance, Europe is on track to meet the GHG emission target
