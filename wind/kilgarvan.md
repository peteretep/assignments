# Kikgaran wind farm

Access road from main road.
ESB substation at the gate.
Second substation at wind farm.
Spur line from main 110kV line.
5 different wind farms going into the one ESB substation.

Brookfield are the current owners. Bought from Bord Gais, and SWS before that.

Access road built to transport turbines. Cut through rock and peat areas.
Roads built with gentle bends to accomodate trucks with 45m + loads.
Forestry in area managed by Caoilte, but Brookfield own the land.
Some forestry cleared to improve wind conditions - surface roughness.

There seems to be a bit of a mircroclimate going on. Rain on west side of the hill.
Wind conditions?

Main turbines Vestas V90 3MV. Developed as an offshore machine, first deployment onshore. Approx 8 years old. 90m diameter with 75m hub height.

45 on site??? which site

Also, Norex? turbines N90? Norex type 3 maintenance just finished. Every bolt tightened and battery backups for pitch control replaced. 1 week downtime per turbine 8/10 hrs per day.

Turbines produce at 1000V and voltage is stepped up to 20kV at the bottom of the turbine. On-site voltage is 20kV. Stepped up to 110kV at Brookfield operated substation at top of the site.

Wind on the day - average 10m/s but very variable, from 6m/s - 13m/s.
Approx capacity factor of 75%.
Turbine pitch was constantally changing. Operated automatically.

Curtailment. Generally all power produced is taken by grid.
Ray's neighbouring wind farm - 100MW. Due to wind conditions he expected curtailemnt to 75MW at night.
Non firm connection, which means no compensation for curtailment.

Public relations important.

# Vestas V90
Tvhe V90-3.0 MWÂ® is designed to be low weight ensuring easy transportation and installation while reducing foundation costs thanks to its lower load.

The nacelle is lighter because its gearbox has an integrated main bearing that eliminates the need for a traditional main shaft. Blade weight is also kept to a minimum by using carbon together with glass fibre. The tower is lighter, too, as it uses magnets instead of welding to attach the tower internals to the tower wall.

This turbine delivers exceptional performance and a high yield, and can be supplied in a variety of hub heights (65-105 m) to accommodate site-specific needs. The tower for offshore is designed site-specific and is furthermore protected with a special offshore coating to withstand the harsh environment.
