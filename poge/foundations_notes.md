Earthquakes / seismic activity

# The nature of the soil
sediments in saturated state
sediment thickness varies on a regional scale - higher near coasts
finer grained further from coasts
In some areas, no sediments due to strong currents
consilidation state

# Geohazards
seismic activity
landslides
active faults
mud diapirs ??
nature of the soil

siliceous sands vs calcareous sand
## Calcereous sand
made from shells/skelletons calcium carbonate. fragile and highly compressible
## Siliceous sand
hard, rounded grains



Debris flows
shallow gas accumulation

For cost-effectiveness, offshore wind farms should be located in areas with high wind speeds, in shallow waters, a short distance from shore, with a deep layer of sand at the sea bottom. Wind speed, however, tends to increase with distance from shore and developments further from shore tend to have a smaller aesthetic impact. At this point, there is a need for assessments of offshore wind power potential in the country.


# Monopiles
Typically driven


# Challenges of installing operating and maintaining ....
Drilling operations may also be complicated by seabed conditions. Seacore described the glacial overburden it encountered at Yttre Stengrund as the most difficult it had ever encountered. Huge boulders had to be removed before the sockets could be drilled in the exceptionally hard underlying quartzite sandstone bedrock [6].

# scour 
more pronounced with gravity foundations as they're larger diameter. not a bit issue with monopiles


compressible soils - gravity foundations suitable?

In an offshore setting, water movement and scour is caused both by tidal currents and wave action. As the movement of water by waves decreases by depth,
scour will typically be less in deeper waters.
