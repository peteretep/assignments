  abstract = {Design practice in offshore geotechnical engineering has grown out of onshore practice, but the two application areas have tended to diverge over the last thirty years, driven partly by the scale of the foundation and anchoring elements used offshore, and partly by fundamental differences in construction and installation techniques. As a consequence offshore geotechnical engineering has grown as a speciality.  The structure of Offshore Geotechnical Engineering follows a pattern that mimics the flow of a typical offshore project. In the early chapters it provides a brief overview of the marine environment, offshore site investigation techniques and interpretation of soil behaviour. It proceeds to cover geotechnical design of piled foundations, shallow foundations and anchoring systems. Three topics are then covered which require a more multi-disciplinary approach: the design of mobile drilling rigs, pipelines and geohazards.  This book serves as a framework for undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and will appeal to professional engineers specialising in the offshore industry.},

monopiles tend to become 
extremely wide as turbines grow and grav
ity base structures are known to experience 
very significant heave forces
 at exposed sites with intermediate water depth

 The sand waves overlay 5 m firm clay, 
which starts at 36 m below MSL. The next
 35 m consist of fine to medium dense 
sand, followed by clay with sand intercalation

 For the monopile and piled tripod the effect of 
omission of scour protection is looked at. 
For the gravity base and suction buckets 
scour is expected to be unacceptable, due 
to their high reliance 
on near-surface soil. 

faOn larger scale natural sediment displacements
 may result in rise or drop of the entire 
seabed around the structure. The magnitude 
is independent of size of the construction 
and can be several meters at some North 
Sea sites. These site
s are particularly 
unsuitable for gravity bases, suction bucke
ts and to some extent piled tripods. 

When no scour protection is applied, a scour hole of approximately 1.5 times the pile 
diameter is expected. The foundation pile ha
s to be adapted to this hole by increasing 
diameter and wall thickness with 7% each a
nd increasing pile penetration with 4.8 m, 
resulting in an increase of mass by approxi
mately 35%. Additionally, a means to cross 
the scour hole with the electricity cable 
has to be provided.

 The weight of 
a gravity base has to be sufficient to avoid 
uplift, tilting and sliding, while at the same 
time avoiding failure of the subsoil. The ma
in parameters to achieve this balance are 
the diameter and height of the gravity 
base
